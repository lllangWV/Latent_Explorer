# Latent Explorer

The "LatentExplorer" project is a cutting-edge Python package designed to delve into the fascinating world of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). By focusing on training, analyzing, and visualizing VAEs, this project opens up new avenues for understanding and exploring the complex, high-dimensional latent spaces that these models generate. Aimed at researchers, data scientists, and enthusiasts in the field of machine learning, "LatentSpaceExplorer" offers a comprehensive toolkit for creating, training, and experimenting with VAEs. Through its modular architecture, including dedicated modules for model definition, data preprocessing, training processes, and latent space exploration, the package simplifies the intricate process of VAE experimentation. 
## Features

- **Varaitional Autoencoder:** 
- **Materials Structure and Composition Input:** Designed to work with various forms of material data including structural and compositional information.


## Installation

To install Latent Explorer, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install latentexp
```

# Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use Latent Explorer:

```python
from latentexp import LatentExplorerModel

# Initialize the model
model = LatentExplorerModel()

# Input your material's structure or composition
material_data = 'YOUR_MATERIAL_DATA'

# Predict properties
predicted_properties = model.predict(material_data)
print(predicted_properties)
```

Replace 'YOUR_MATERIAL_DATA' with your actual materials data.
