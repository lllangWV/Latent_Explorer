# Latent Explorer

The "LatentExplorer" project is a cutting-edge Python package designed to delve into the fascinating world of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). By focusing on training, analyzing, and visualizing VAEs, this project opens up new avenues for understanding and exploring the complex, high-dimensional latent spaces that these models generate. Aimed at researchers, data scientists, and enthusiasts in the field of machine learning, "LatentSpaceExplorer" offers a comprehensive toolkit for creating, training, and experimenting with VAEs. Through its modular architecture, including dedicated modules for model definition, data preprocessing, training processes, and latent space exploration, the package simplifies the intricate process of VAE experimentation. 

## Features

- **Varaitional Autoencoder:** 
- **Materials Structure and Composition Input:** Designed to work with various forms of material data including structural and compositional information.


## Installation

**Create and Activate Conda Environment:** In your project directory, there is a `env_gpu.yml` file with the necessary dependencies, including Python version and pip. Create and activate a anaconda enviroment:

```bash
conda env create -f env_linux.yml
conda activate latentent
```

# Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use Latent Explorer:

```python
from latentexp import LatentExplorerModel
```

Replace 'YOUR_MATERIAL_DATA' with your actual materials data.
